# Autochthon Virtual Machine

The `avm` project is a collection of a few components:

1. A simple RISC instruction set
2. A binary representation of programs and data for this instruction set
3. A virtual machine to run these binaries
4. An assembler to make writing binaries easier
5. A linker to join together many binaries to create more interesting programs

# Goals


# Implementation

Each program component of the system is written in a different high level language.
